				<h1>About the Craft</h1>
				<p>Although somewhat niche, stapler collecting is an age-old hobby with a rich history, practiced since the dawn of the modern stapler in 1879. Staples come in all shapes, sizes, and colors, ranging from classic <a href="https://www.swingline.com/p/staplers/desktop-staplers/full-size-staplers/nexxt-series-wow-desktop-stapler-40-sheets-blue-55047036-55047036/">Swingline office staplers</a> to heavy-duty <a href="https://www.uline.com/Product/Detail/H-2020/Staplers-and-Staples/Manual-Heavy-Duty-Staple-Gun?pricode=WA9322&gadtype=pla&id=H-2020&gad_source=1&gclid=Cj0KCQiA84CvBhCaARIsAMkAvkJZANlXgkBHYBxVhbh36DLodTAPoPnjDHm_jlogOEHlb8PWE9clf0QaAoCEEALw_wcB">Bostitch staple guns</a>. This diverse array of staplers has fueled he passion of collectors worldwide, with each seeking to add rare staplers to their collection. The sport of modern staple collecting has evolved into a thriving community, enjoying a sizeable fanbase from all corners of the globe. Businesses small and large have also joined the staple craze, with a reported <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stapler#Industry">80 million dollars</a> worth of staplers being bought in 2012 in the United States alone.</p>
				<h1>History of the Stapler</h1>
				<p>The first stapler was invened in 1877 by <a href="https://museumcollection.hagley.org/objects/56694/patent-model-improvement-in-machines-for-forming-inserting-and-clinching-staples-in-books">Henry R. Heyl</a>, which inserted a small metal fastener into a stack of papers. This invention was quickly followed by a stapler with a magazine of staples in 1878. Over the years to follow, staplers became a hit among offices throughout the US. Since then, very few innovations have been made, with the invention of the easy-spring mechanism, designed to reduce the strain on user's hands, being implemented several decades ago. Despite a lack of new technology, staplers continue to be extremely prevalent among offices everywhere.</p>
				<h1>Tools of the Trade</h1>
				<p>The avid collector is rarely seen without a wide array of nets, binoculars, and other accessories used for catching and identifying staplers in the wild, including tape measures, magnifying glasses, calipers, and of course this very website. Staplers are most frequently found in office supply stores, but other common habitats include offices, homes, and schools. While the majority of stapler enthusiasts search for their staplers in the captivity of stores or offices, hunting staplers in their native rainforest habitat requires a significant investment in equipment. Firstly, a quality backpack is a must—one good backpack, along with food and water for sustained energy is the key for productive stapler hunting. Any serious stapler hunter should also bring plenty of backup nets, in case their primary net is torn by some of the more aggressive staplers. Finally, a reinforced compartment of the backpack should be reserved for carrying captured staplers—but be warned, this can get quite heavy! Make sure to practice carrying heavy things for a bit before going on your first staple hunt. Happy hunting!</p>
