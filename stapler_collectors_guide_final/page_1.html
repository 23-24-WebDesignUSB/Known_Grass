				<p>Firstly, Mr. Considine's stapler is very springy—not quite perfect, but very close. It is quite powerful, having stapled through 20 papers at once. Its sound is exacly the sound you want for a stapler. It is very effecive as well—all of Thomas's paper is now stuck togther. Overall, it is a great stapler. 10/11.</p>
