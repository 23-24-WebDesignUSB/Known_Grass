				<h1>About the Craft</h1>
				<p>Stapler collecting is an age-old hobby practiced since the dawn of the modern stapler in 1879. Staples come in all shapes, sizes, and colors, ranging from classic Swingline office stapler to heavy-duty Bostitch staple guns. The modern staple collecting sport enjoys a sizeable following, with businesses all over the world participating in the staple craze.</p>
				<h1>History of the Stapler</h1>
				<p>The first stapler was invened in 1877 by Henry R. Heyl, which inserted a small metal fastener into a stack of papers. This invention was quickly followed by a stapler with a magazine of staples in 1878. Over the years to follow, staplers would become a hit among offices throughout the US. Since then, very few innovations have been made, with the invention of the easy-spring mechanism, designed to reduce the strain on user's hands, being implemented several decades ago.</p>
				<h1>Tools of the Trade</h1>
				The avid collector is rarely seen without a wide array of nets, binoculars, and other accessories used for catching staplers in the wild. Staplers are most frequently found in office supply stores, but other common habitats include offices, homes, and schools.</p>
